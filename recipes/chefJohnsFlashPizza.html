    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Cheesy, pepperoni-topped pizzas with a crispy, chewy crust. 
        The homemade dough is inspired by the famous 2-ingredient 
        pizza doughs, with just a few more ingredients to add better 
        flavor, and it's ready to top and bake in just 10 minutes.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups self-rising flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix 2 cups self-rising flour, sugar, and 
            Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for dough in a bowl 
            until well combined. Add olive oil and Greek yogurt 
            and mix with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms. 
            Clean off the spoon and mix the dough with your 
            hands until it mostly comes together.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a work surface and continue 
            pushing it together until it smooths out. It will
             be dry; don't be tempted yet to add more liquid. 
             Knead dough until smooth and elastic, 3 to 4 
             minutes, only adding a teaspoon or two of water 
             or flour if absolutely necessary. Cut dough into 
             two equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment 
            paper and sprinkle 1 tablespoon cornmeal over the surface.</li>
        <li>Roll one piece dough on a lightly floured surface to an 
            1/8-inch-thick rectangle. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Top dough with ½ of the pizza sauce, spreading it almost, 
            but not quite all the way, to the edges. Sprinkle ½ of the 
            mozzarella over the sauce, then ½ of the Parmigiano-Reggiano 
            over top. Arrange ½ of the pepperoni slices over the cheese, 
            then drizzle 1 teaspoon oil over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until crust is 
            beautifully browned and toppings are bubbly, about 15 minutes. 
            Transfer to a wire rack and let sit for 5 minutes 
            before slicing and serving.</li>
        <li>As soon as you remove the pizza from the 
            oven, repeat Steps 3 to 6 to top and bake second pizza.</li>
    </ol>
